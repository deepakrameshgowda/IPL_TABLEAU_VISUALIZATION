# IPL_TABLEAU_VISUALIZATION
Dashboard view of Player statistics, Match statistics and Team statistics.

Initially the matches.csv and deliveries.csv file was given for visualization.

First starting step of my analysis was transforming both the files to single excel file named deliveries_matches.excel.

This transformed file was used for all my further enhancements in tableau.

The pdf has assumptions and explanations for each cases.

The Tableau packaged workbook along with extract can be seen in ----> https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/deepak.ramesh
